# Version History

## 3.0.2

Works on Windows again (how silly of me to assume `os.sched_getaffinity` would be multiplatform).

## 3.0.1

Allow `replay_manager` to accept directories or `.zip` files.

## 3.0.0

Totally reworked. Run modes:

- `single`
- `directory`
- `replay_manager`

New addition of GUI.

## Prior

Ancient history.
